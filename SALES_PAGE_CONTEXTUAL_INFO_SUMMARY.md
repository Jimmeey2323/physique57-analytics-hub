### üîß Updated External Document Service

1. **Removed All Mock/Sample Data**
   - Eliminated hardcoded trainer names (Priya Sharma, Arjun Patel, etc.)
   - Removed sample insights and recommendations
   - Removed mock sales data and trends
   - Cleared all placeholder content

2. **Implemented Real Data Fetching**
   - Added Google Docs API integration attempt
   - Implemented document parsing logic
   - Created content type detection methods
   - Added section-based parsing

3. **Enhanced Data Parsing**
   - Added methods to detect trainer entries, insights, recommendations
   - Implemented sales data parsing for trends and action items
   - Created class format data extraction
   - Added retention and session data parsing
   - Implemented general insights extraction

4. **Fallback Handling**
   - Returns empty data structures when document is unavailable
   - No mock data displayed when external source fails
   - Clean error handling with console warnings

## Current Behavior

### When Kwality House is Selected:
- ‚úÖ Info icons appear beside all requested components
- ‚úÖ Icons attempt to fetch real data from Google Doc
- ‚úÖ If document is unavailable, icons don't display (empty data)
- ‚úÖ No mock/sample data is ever shown

### When Other Locations are Selected:
- ‚úÖ No info icons appear (clean interface)
- ‚úÖ No external API calls made
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized for non-Kwality views

## Data Sources

### Google Document Integration:
- **Document ID**: `1p-hxVjAHFvuyBo1l04ibxRQIkNj4-VzcFO1-viFN3gw`
- **Fetch Method**: Attempts published export format first
- **Parse Method**: Intelligent content parsing by section keywords
- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes for performance

### Content Detection:
- **Trainer Data**: Names, performance metrics, ratings
- **Sales Insights**: Revenue notes, trends, action items  
- **Class Formats**: Popular formats, attendance, feedback
- **Retention**: Tips, churn analysis, success stories
- **Sessions**: Peak times, utilization, optimization
- **General**: Market trends, competitor analysis, opportunities

## Technical Implementation

### Components Enhanced:
```typescript
<WithContextualInfo
  dataType="salesInsights"
  currentLocation={activeLocation}
  title="Custom Title"
  iconPosition="top-right"
  iconSize="sm"
>
  <YourComponent />
</WithContextualInfo>
```

### Data Flow:
1. User selects Kwality House location
2. `useKwalityHouseSelection` hook detects selection
3. `useExternalDocumentData` hook triggers data fetch
4. `externalDocumentService` attempts Google Docs fetch
5. Content parsed into structured format
6. `ContextualInfoIcon` displays parsed data
7. If fetch fails, no data shown (empty arrays)

## Next Steps

### To Complete Integration:
1. **Make Google Doc Public**: Set sharing to "Anyone with link can view"
2. **Test Document Format**: Ensure document has proper sections
3. **Verify Content Structure**: Check that parsing detects your content
4. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for API rate limits or timeouts

### Document Structure Recommendations:
- Use clear section headers (TRAINER PERFORMANCE, SALES INSIGHTS, etc.)
- Include bullet points or numbered lists
- Add percentages and metrics for automatic detection
- Structure recommendations with action-oriented language

## Files Modified

### Components:
- `src/components/dashboard/SalesAnalyticsSection.tsx` - Added contextual info to all tables and components, removed AiNotes

### Services:
- `src/services/externalDocumentService.ts` - Completely rewritten to use real data parsing instead of mock data

### No Changes Required:
- Hook files remain unchanged
- UI components remain unchanged
- Other pages retain existing contextual info implementations

The implementation now ensures that **only real document data** appears in the contextual info icons when Kwality House is selected, and **no mock data** is ever displayed to users.
