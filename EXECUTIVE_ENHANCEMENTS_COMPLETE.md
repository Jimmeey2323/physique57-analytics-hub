## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **PDF Generation Time**: Can be slow for many locations (sequential processing)
   - *Mitigation*: Progress toasts keep user informed
   - *Future*: Parallel generation or server-side processing

2. **Screenshot Quality**: Depends on browser rendering
   - *Mitigation*: 2x scale provides good quality
   - *Future*: Server-side Puppeteer for consistent quality

3. **Mobile PDF Generation**: Not recommended on mobile devices
   - *Reason*: Heavy memory usage during capture
   - *Recommendation*: Desktop/laptop only

4. **Chart Animations**: Frozen at moment of capture
   - *Expected behavior*: Screenshots capture current state
   - *Not a bug*: Charts are still interactive in dashboard

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Location Tab Usage
- Click "All Locations" to see aggregate data across all studios

- Use with filters (date range, etc.) for deeper analysis

### Drilldown Analytics
- Look for trends across the 6-month chart
- Compare last month bar vs current month
- Check insights for specific KPIs
- Use to identify areas needing attention

### PDF Report Generation
- **Best Practice**: Generate during off-peak hours

- Don't navigate away during generation
- PDFs are named with location and date for easy organization
