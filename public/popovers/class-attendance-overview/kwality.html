                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Executive Summary: The Polarization Problem</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Kwality House is not a struggling studio; it is a highly successful studio trapped inside an inefficient one. The November data paints a picture of extreme polarization: a core of "A-List" classes that are consistently sold-out, profitable, and beloved by members, existing alongside a "B-List" of "ghost classes" that drain resources, damage the brand, and artificially depress the studio's overall performance metrics.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 p-5 bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 rounded-r-lg text-indigo-800 text-lg font-semibold">
                    The diagnosis is clear: this is not a product problem—your members love your core offerings. This is a critical resource allocation and scheduling failure. The strategic imperative is to stop subsidizing failure with success and transform the schedule from a gamble into a finely tuned, data-driven revenue machine.

                            <li><strong class="text-gray-900">The Power of Prime Time:</strong> The data confirms that early mornings (7-9 AM), evenings (6-8 PM), and weekend mornings are your economic engines. Demand in these windows is proven and powerful.</li>
                             <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Your Star Power Instructors:</strong> Atulan Purohit and Rohan Dahima are not just staff; they are significant revenue drivers. Their names are associated with the highest fill rates and represent a powerful marketing tool.</li>

                            <li><strong class="text-gray-900">The `powerCycle` Paradox:</strong> This class is both a star and a liability. A 96.7% fill rate on Wednesday AM proves the format is desirable. The 0% fill rate on Tuesday AM proves its success is acutely sensitive to time and instructor. Placing this class in the wrong slot is the equivalent of lighting money on fire.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-gray-900">The Mid-Day & Late-Night Dead Zones:</strong> The schedule from 10 AM to 5 PM and after 8:30 PM is a graveyard of low-performing classes. Each class run here with sub-20% attendance represents a net financial loss and a waste of your best instructors' time.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-gray-900">The "Instructor Roulette" Risk:</strong> The "Multiple Values" listed for trainers in many time slots is a massive red flag. It indicates a lack of consistency that breeds member uncertainty. A member loyal to one instructor's style may cancel if they see a substitute, leading to last-minute drop-offs and a diluted brand experience.</li>
